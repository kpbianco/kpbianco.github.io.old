**2. General Description of Product**

Our app will have a timer to track the amount of time each person is spending on their hobby and use that time to show them the total time they have been practicing. Then they can view all their practice times in one place to track their progress. They will also be able to discover new hobbies through the app to learn new skills. There will be a journal function so that they can track their thoughts also to get what is in their mind out so that they can organize it.

Our diagram shows the flow from logon to the main page. It starts off at the bottom with the user inputting data then it signs them it and check with the auth servers to make sure they are a valid user. Then it calls the wrapper function which in turn calls main. But if the user is logged in the program can skip all this and just calls main. Main in turn calls home which has all the other pages of the app attached to it.

**2.3 Product Functions (general)**
Our product will have a timer to track the practice time of users. It will also have a calendar to show the information from the timer. A home page that brings everything together and a way to enhance your skills for hobbies and a way to discover new hobbies. 

**2.4 User Characteristics and Expectations**

The users that will use this app will want to learn something new or want to get better at something they donâ€™t know that well. They will understand something but would like to know more.

**2.5 Constraints**

Some of the constrains we have are being able to find information about the hobbies on the app so that people can learn new information. Another constraint we have is to make sure the information we are providing is accurate.

**2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies**

We do have some dependences. We depend on the firebase auth so that users can login to the app. And there are plugins for the calendar and timer needed to display the calendar, play audio on the timer and send notifications for the timer and other parts of the app. Some other assumptions are that the database will sync the user data correctly. The database will also depend on firebase like the login.

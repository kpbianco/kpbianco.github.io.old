# NCK Problem Statement


NCK, comprised of Nhan Le, Cameron Clapp, and Kian Bianco is a team dedicated to creating a modern-day solution for tracking your hobbies.

The solution in question solves the problem of working disorderly and primitively regarding how you spend your free time on the things you enjoy. Most people just spend their free time leisurely and do not realize by just helping it out slightly they can be much more productive and fulfilled in their hobbies. This is important because, in our current day, there are apps for every aspect of our lives. You can track your mood, finances, your calendar, everything. 
 
This aspect allows us to manage our own lives in an introspective and retroactive manner that further boosts our productivity, keeps us organized, and generally is better, as proven by its wide adoption and encouragement. 

# Why should we care? 

Well literally everyone in the world has hobbies, even the people you would say do not, really do under the hood. If everyone in the world has hobbies, and 96% of the people in the world have cell phones as of 2019 (PEW Research Center), there is a huge target for such a solution. 
Most people would be able to benefit from such a solution even if their hobby was as simple as collecting rocks.


NCK intends to solve this problem by creating an application using flutter, which allows us to publish on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux, which allows us to affect that entire 96% percent of people by being versatile. Our app will have several elements that will help every person fulfill their needs and desires when it comes to bolstering their hobby practices. 

## First Feature (Hobby Inquiry)
Upon booting up the app for the first time (and potentially later) you can interact with an AI that will prompt you with questions and determine your skill ranging from beginner to amateur to professional and give you curated content accordingly. It will let you select hobbies you already do, some you are interested in learning in, and much more. This is helpful because we plan on having curated content for your skill level, such as tutorials, social network feeds related (will get to later), forum tags, etc… You will be able to fully benefit from this feature in your growth of the hobby.

## Second Feature (Hobby Tracking Calendar)
The calendar will track when you do your hobby, for how long, and what you worked on. Having a calendar like this will properly let you plan your hobbies, work on certain things that you desire, and stick to fulfilling them. We will aim to have AI give input on this calendar like “You worked 20% more on this hobby than normal, are you struggling with something or are you enjoying it?”—where depending on their input can suggest tutorials, etc…

## Third Feature (Social Network)
People can see infinite scrolling feeds for their hobbies, post content such as their work they’ve created or how they’ve improved, chat rooms for the hobby with their associated skill level, etc… also integrating a forum, where people can ask higher-skilled people for advice. This feature would also include a place that the user can go to group classes for their hobby and improve their skill or meet with mentors or coaches who would do the same but with more personal attention (this would be where the monetization potential would be).

## Final Feature (Misc Features)
The final feature would be sort of a miscellaneous feature list that would just in general benefit everyone. We would have various tools such as a Pomodoro timer, which would help the user practice their hobby most efficiently and avoid burnout. There would be an inventory, where you can keep track of the items for your hobbies that you have and whether you may be running low, or if you can buy more, etc... We would have a checklist or an itinerary for your hobby needs.
With all of this combined we at NCK hope that we would solve the problem of the lack of a better solution for exploring your hobbies.
